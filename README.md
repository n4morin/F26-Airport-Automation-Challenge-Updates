## Your Mission

Modern airports rely on connected systems to move passengers, aircraft, baggage, and staff safely and efficiently. Brock Solutions builds and integrates software for these real airport operations.

In this challenge, your team has been invited to prototype a software or software-adjacent solution for an airport automation problem. You may extend the supplied code, combine ideas from several sub-problems, or create a related solution of your own. Your solution should be realistic enough to connect to airport operations, but focused enough to prototype during the challenge.

Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) is the recommended airline for this challenge, but you can build your solution for any airport of your choosing. An airport like Pearson handles about 128,000 passengers daily, and might route routing their luggage through a web of thousands of conveyors. This complicated web of passengers, luggage, flights, gates, need good software to manage. To build good software, think like an airport systems engineer:

- expect incomplete, late, or conflicting data
- consider safety, privacy, accessibility, and operational constraints
- build a simple working version before adding complexity
- explain the decisions and trade-offs behind your design
- show how your idea could connect to a larger airport system

Airport systems are message driven and closely connected. A passenger update in a Departure Control System can affect baggage handling, aircraft readiness, gate planning, and the operational information used by other teams. Your prototype does not need to model the whole airport, but it should understand where it fits.

As you make your solution this weekend, use the [judging criteria](#judging-criteria) to guide your decisions and demonstration.

## Sub-Problems

### [Baggage Handling System](baggage-handling-system/README.md)

A Baggage Handling System (BHS) identifies, tracks, routes, and sorts bags through scanners, conveyors, diverters, make-up areas, and carousels. A bad routing decision can delay a passenger, a flight, or an entire baggage pier.

#### Challenge

Your challenge is to design a BHS that can identify, track, route baggage through a simplified baggage handling environment, and detect anomalies or foreign objects on conveyor systems to ensure operational safety.

![Baggage moving through an airport conveyor system](images/conveyor_system.webp)

#### Potential Directions

Potential solution directions:

* SecureBag - Security against malicious attempts at switching baggage [[Supported]](baggage-handling-system/securebag/README.md)
* Control a real conveyor system to simulate bag movement through a network [[Supported]](baggage-handling-system/barcode-conveyor/README.md)
* Error handling for unreadable, oversized, overweight, fragile, or untagged bags
* Foreign object or anomaly detection on conveyor tracks
* Emergency stop, slowdown, or warning signals for conveyor operations
* Simulation of bag movement through a simplified conveyor network
* Privacy-conscious tracking that avoids unnecessary passenger personal information

Your solution may be software-only, hardware-assisted, simulation-based, or a mix of all three.

### [Gate Management System](gate-management-system/README.md)

![Example of aircraft being assigned to airport gates](images/gate_assgt.png)

A Gate Management System (GMS) assigns aircraft to gates while considering timing, aircraft size, passenger needs, customs rules, cargo restrictions, outages, and delays. A gate plan must remain valid as the day changes.

#### Challenge

Your challenge is to produce a conflict-free gate plan and update it when disruption messages arrive. The supplied evaluator checks aircraft-gate compatibility, overlapping occupancy, gate outages, reassignment costs, and other operational rules.

### Potential Directions

  Potential solution directions:

  * Greedy scoring-aware assignment algorithm [Supported](gate-management-system/solution_scored.py)
  * First-fit baseline algorithm [Supported](gate-management-system/solution_firstfit.py)
  * Disruption repair (delay, outage, equipment swap) [Supported](gate-management-system/solution_scored.py)
  * Operator dashboard / interactive timeline visualizer [Supported](gate-management-system/visualize.py)
  * Scenario analysis across busy/emergency/cargo/overnight cases [Supported](gate-management-system/visualize.py)
  * Security/restricted gates (origin-specific secure gate rules)
  * Airline gate preferences (soft-reward scoring)
  * Turnaround service buffer between aircraft at same gate
  * Constraint-solver (ILP/CP-SAT) replacement for greedy heuristic
  * Predictive disruption handling from historical delay patterns
  * Adversarial scenario generator to stress-test beyond fixed scenarios
  * Assignment explainability layer ("why gate X for flight Y")
  * Live what-if simulator for manual override impact

#### Starting Point

This is the most structured coding subproblem. You may write your own assignment algorithm or build a larger tool around the supplied baseline.

### [Air Traffic Control System](air-traffic-control/README.md)

![Air traffic controller monitoring aircraft](images/air-traffic-controller.jpg)

Air Traffic Control (ATC) automation combines surveillance reports, flight-plan updates, route information, and controller inputs to estimate where an aircraft is and where it is going. Those messages can be noisy, delayed, incomplete, or contradictory.

#### Challenge

Your challenge is to process a simulated aircraft message stream, reconstruct the likely route, estimate the aircraft state, predict its next waypoint and arrival time, and flag information that should not be trusted without review.

#### Potential Solutions

##### Supported Solution

* ATC message-stream tracking starter kit [[Supported]](air-traffic-control/starter-kit/README.md) — reconstruct routes, estimate aircraft state, detect anomalous reports, compare route hypotheses, plan around blocked waypoints, and visualize results.

##### Additional Possibilities

* Multi-aircraft conflict and separation-risk detection
* Arrival sequencing and runway scheduling
* Airport-surface tracking and taxi-route conflict monitoring
* Weather-aware rerouting decision support
* Airspace-sector congestion and controller-workload forecasting
* Emergency, diversion, and lost-communication response planning
* Raw ADS-B/Mode S message ingestion using the Python `pyModeS` decoder, following [The 1090 Megahertz Riddle](https://mode-s.org/1090mhz/), and adapting the decoded aircraft state for the starter tracker. `pyModeS` is already included in the ATC requirements.

#### Starting Point

The starter kit includes repeatable scenarios, a working tracker, a simulator with known ground truth, optional advanced tools, and a live-aircraft demo.

### [Departure Control System](departure-control-system/README.md)

![Departure control system](images/dcs.png)

A Departure Control System (DCS) manages the departure side of an airline operation, including check-in, identity and document verification, baggage acceptance, boarding passes, boarding status, and aircraft load control.

#### Challenge

Your challenge is to choose one part of that pipeline and make its state and decisions clear. A strong project might help an operator understand whether a passenger, bag, or flight is ready, what needs attention, and why.

### Potential Directions

  Potential solution directions:

  * Unified identity gateway: booking, doc checks, seat, bag declare, boarding pass, agent review, audit
  log [Supported](departure-control-system/README.md)
  * Aircraft load control (weight/balance zone assignment) [Supported](departure-control-system/README.md)
  * Passenger-processing checkpoint monitor
  * Document-review assistant w/ mismatch confidence scoring
  * Baggage reconciliation linking declared bags to scan events
  * Flight-close readiness aggregator (identity + load + baggage in one score)
  * Override/audit-log analytics for staff workload + rule-override patterns
  * Accessibility-first check-in flow variant

#### Starting Points

Two working examples show an appropriate scope:

- [Unified Identity Gateway](departure-control-system/unified-identity-gateway/README.md), covering identity checks, seat selection, baggage declaration, boarding passes, and agent review
- [Load Control](departure-control-system/load-control/), covering aircraft weight-and-balance optimization

## Development Approach

1. Choose one clear operational problem.
2. Run or inspect the supplied example before changing it.
3. Build the smallest complete version of your idea.
4. Add validation and handle a few meaningful edge cases.
5. Test the same inputs before and after each change.
6. Add one distinctive feature if time allows.
7. Prepare a short demonstration and explain your trade-offs.

A reliable, understandable prototype is stronger than several unfinished features.

## Submission

Teams will give a short presentation of about 3 to 5 minutes. Include:

- the problem you chose and who it affects
- how your solution works
- the prototype, simulation, dashboard, or hardware demonstration
- the constraints and edge cases you considered
- the result you achieved
- what you would improve with more time

Your submission may include code, a dashboard, a simulation, a hardware and software demonstration, a design with partial implementation, or a combination of these.
